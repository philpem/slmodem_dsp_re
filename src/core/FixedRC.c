/*
 * FixedRC.c -- Fixed Rate Converter: fixed rational-factor resampling.
 *
 * Reconstructed from dsplibs.o FixedRC.c, .text 0x0b0d90-0x0b1cf0 and the
 * factor tables at .data 0x94e0 / 0x9540.
 *
 * This is the module that lets the datapumps run at 8 kHz while the host runs
 * at 9600.  RcFixed_Resample() is called from exactly four places in the
 * original: dp_wrapper_run(), call_run(), FAX_process() and VOICE_process().
 *
 * Modes 0 and 1 use a different state layout in the original (a 40-byte block
 * with three sub-allocations) and are not implemented here.  They are the
 * explicit-only x4 and /4 entries, unreachable from
 * RcFixed_Check_Combination(), so nothing in the modem can request them.
 */

/*
 * Supported conversion ratios, as (down, up) pairs indexed by mode.
 *
 * The conversion applied is out = in * up / down, so a mode's *down* factor is
 * matched against the input rate and its *up* factor against the output rate,
 * both reduced by their GCD.
 *
 * Reading the interesting entries:
 *
 *   mode 2   5:6    8000 -> 9600   pump to host
 *   mode 3   6:5    9600 -> 8000   host to pump      <- the common case
 *   mode 14  2:3    e.g. 8000 -> 12000
 *   mode 15  3:2
 *   mode 18  9:10   e.g. 7200 -> 8000
 *   mode 19  10:9
 *
 * Modes 8 and 9 duplicate the ratios of modes 0 and 1 (4:1 and 1:4).  They are
 * distinct entries because each mode selects its own filter design in
 * RcFixed_Create()'s jump table, so the same ratio can be offered at two
 * different filter lengths or bandwidths.
 *
 * The trailing {0, 0} is a terminator, and its index doubles as the
 * "unsupported" return value from RcFixed_Check_Combination().

 * `static int`, NOT `const int`, AND UP BEFORE DOWN -- all three read off the

 * addend is a reference to a file-local object: had these been `extern`, the
 * relocation would name them (CLAUDE.md's rule about what a relocation's
 * ABSENCE proves, in its data form).  The section is `.data` and not
 * `.rodata`, so they were not `const` either.  And `down` sits 0x60 BELOW `up`
 * in the blob while GCC 3.4 emits file-scope objects in reverse definition
 * order -- verified on this object -- so `up` was defined first.  Nothing
 * outside this file names either table and no header declares them.
